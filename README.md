# Site Created Using Create T3 App with ZenStack

## Steps to get started with tRPC and ZenStack

### Initialization Commands

- npx create-t3-app@latest
    - Use TypeScript
    - Use tRPC
    - Use NextAuth
    - Use Prisma
    - Use App Router
- npx zenstack@latest init

### Install tRPC ZenStack Plugin
1. npm install @zenstackhq/trpc
2. Add the following to `schema.zmodel`:
```
plugin trpc {
    provider = '@zenstackhq/trpc'
    output = 'src/server/routers/generated'
}
```

or use any other directory you want.

3. By default, Create T3 App will name the database db, while ZenStack requires it to be named prisma. In src/server/api/trpc.ts, change the return of the function createTRPCContext from:

```javascript
  return {
    db,
    session,
    ...opts,
  };
```
to:
```javascript
  return {
    prisma: db,
    session,
    ...opts,
  };
```
The following info is provided by Create T3 App. Have a look around the repository and try running this sample application, or just use it as a reference!
